function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split("").reverse().join("");
    /* step one. Using the split() method we take our current string and split each letter into 
    it's on seperate "sub string"!
    step two. We take all our sub string using the reverse() method to reverse the order of them.
    Step three. We use the join() method to put our reversed string back together into a single string.
     Last, we use return to take the string we would like to reverse using this function and it then
    outputs that to console.log!....or you could just use return if were not using a javascript
     console and this was in a whiteboard interview. GG*/
